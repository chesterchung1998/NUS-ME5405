# NUS-ME5405
An in-depth machine vision project which touches upon image processing procedures such as conversion of image into a binary image (thresholding), determining a one-pixel thin image of objects (thinning), outlining and labelling objects in the image (segmentation), and classification of images using unsupervised methods including k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM). 
- Main codes can be found in the MATLAB files named 'Image_1_Main_Script.m' and 'Image_2_Main_Script.m'. The other MATLAB files are helper scripts.
- Input dataset can be found in the files named 'hello_world.jpg', 'chromo.txt, and in the zip folder named 'p_dataset_26.zip'.
- The algorithms used and results derived in the project are thoroughly discussed in the report titled 'ME5405 Project Report.pdf'.
